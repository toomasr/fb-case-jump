FogBugz Case Jump
=================

I've been using FogBugz (FB) for couple of years now. I like that certain type of work is in FB
rather than in some email message, chat log or post-it note. I especially like bug reports and other
technical issues to be in FB.

Once you've got lots of stuff in FB and people refer to cases by number rather than the URL
you would like to access those cases quicker. Hence the FB Case Jump.

This is a Chrome extension that you can install from
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fb-case-jump/jgmeghoofjjfmdnhelghhefkbddijnie/related)
and it will let you type in the address bar **fb 12345** and it will direct you to your FB issue.
