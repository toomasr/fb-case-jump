FogBugz Case Jump
=================

I've been using FogBugz for couple of years. Also I like that certain type of work is in FogBugz
rather than in some email, chat or post-it note. I especially like bug reports and other
technical issues to be in FogBugz.

Once you've got lots of stuff in FogBugz and people refer to cases by number rather than the URL
you would like to access those cases quicker. Hence the FogBugz Case Jump.

This is a Chrome extension that you can install from Chrome Web Store[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fb-case-jump/jgmeghoofjjfmdnhelghhefkbddijnie/related] and it will let you type in the address bar **fb 12345** and it will direct you to your FogBugz issue.
